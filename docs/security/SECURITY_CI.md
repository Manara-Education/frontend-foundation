# Security CI — frontend-foundation

How the **Security Gate** works, what it does and does not cover, how to
reproduce every scan on a laptop, and what to do when it blocks you.

The gate is mandatory: a pull request into `develop` or `main` cannot merge
while it is failing, and a release cannot deploy without a passing verdict on
the exact commit being released.

---

## 1. When it runs

| Trigger | What is assessed |
|---|---|
| `pull_request` → `develop`/`main` (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review, edited) | the PR's **head commit** |
| `push` → `develop`/`main` (including every PR merge) | the pushed commit |
| `schedule` — `23 3 * * *` UTC | **both** `develop` and `main`, at their current revisions |
| `workflow_dispatch` | whatever ref you dispatch against |

GitHub only runs scheduled workflows from the **default branch** (`develop`), so
a scan of `main` would never happen on its own — `security.yml` builds an
explicit two-target matrix on `schedule` and records the head SHA of each branch.
GitHub's scheduler is also best-effort: runs are delayed under load and
occasionally dropped, which is why the cron sits at `:23` rather than on the
hour, and why the daily scan is a safety net rather than the only defence.

There are **no workflow-level path filters**. A path filter would stop the
workflow running on a PR that only touches `README.md` — and a required check
that never reports leaves the PR permanently unmergeable.

`merge_group` is deliberately absent: this repository has no merge queue
(verified against the rulesets API). If one is enabled, add
`merge_group: [checks_requested]` and validate the queued merge revision.

## 2. What is scanned

| Report id | Tool | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `deps-osv` | osv-scanner 2.5.1 | Every npm dependency, direct and transitive, from `package-lock.json` (480+ packages) |
| `deps-trivy` | Trivy 0.74.0 | Second opinion on dependencies; vendor advisories OSV lags on |
| `sast-codeql` | CodeQL (bundle v2.26.4) | `javascript-typescript` static analysis |
| `secrets-gitleaks` | gitleaks 8.30.1 | Committed history, plus the PR's own commit range |
| `config-trivy` | Trivy | Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflows |
| `image-trivy` | Trivy | The built container image — Caddy runtime **and** OS packages |
| `deps-diff-review` | `dependency-review-action` | The PR's dependency **difference**, against the GitHub Advisory Database |

**Why both a diff review and a full dependency scan.** `dependency-review` only
sees what a PR *changed*. It cannot see a vulnerability disclosed yesterday in a
dependency the PR never touched — the most common way a "previously green"
branch becomes unsafe. It is an addition to full scanning, never a replacement,
and it is the one report the policy marks PR-only.

**Why the image scan matters more here than the dependency scan.** The npm tree
is currently clean, but the runtime image is not: the application ships inside
`caddy:2-alpine`, and everything in that base image — the Caddy binary's compiled
Go modules, the Go standard library, and the Alpine packages — is part of what is
deployed. A scan that stopped at `package-lock.json` would report a green
frontend while shipping a base image with known critical vulnerabilities.

## 3. What blocks

From `.github/security/policy.yml`, the single source of truth. The workflow YAML
decides nothing; `.github/security/evaluate.py` reads that policy and makes every
judgement.

- **HIGH** and **CRITICAL** block.
- Anything on the **CISA KEV** catalogue blocks **regardless of severity label**.
  Confirmed exploitation in the wild outranks a base score computed in the
  abstract.
- **Any detected secret** blocks. The remedy for a false positive is a narrow,
  approved exception — not a lowered threshold.
- MEDIUM and below are recorded and reported, but do not block.

The gate also fails — separately and explicitly — when it *cannot* reach a
verdict: a scanner errored, was cancelled or unexpectedly skipped; a required
report is missing, empty or unparseable; mandatory intelligence is unavailable or
older than the freshness window; or an exception is expired or malformed.

Exit codes: **0** passed · **1** blocking findings · **2** could not be
evaluated. Both non-zero codes block; they read differently so you can tell "we
found something" from "we could not look".

### Severity mapping between tools

Normalised scale: `CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW > INFO`.

| Tool | Source of truth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| osv-scanner | GHSA severity word | GHSA's `MODERATE` maps to `MEDIUM`; falls back to computing a CVSS v3.1 base score from the vector |
| Trivy | its own five words | identity mapping, written out so a future label change shows as a diff |
| CodeQL / SARIF | rule `security-severity` number | scored on the CVSS bands; SARIF `level` is only a fallback, because it describes loudness, not danger |
| gitleaks | — | ungraded by design; every finding blocks |

An `UNKNOWN` severity maps to **MEDIUM**, never dropped. Dropping it would
silently delete a finding nobody has scored yet; mapping it to HIGH would make
the gate unusable and push people toward suppressions.

## 4. Vulnerability intelligence and freshness

Sources are registered in `.github/security/sources.yml`. Mandatory: **OSV**,
**GitHub Advisory Database**, **Trivy DB**, **CISA KEV**. Advisory: NVD.

Every run refreshes intelligence *before* any scanner runs and records what it
got — retrieval time, upstream revision, entry counts — in an
`intelligence-manifest.json` shipped as an artifact. Maximum age is **24 hours**;
exceeding it fails the gate.

Each scanner must provably use that data. osv-scanner is pointed at the
pre-downloaded snapshot via `OSV_SCANNER_LOCAL_DB_CACHE_DIRECTORY` plus
`--offline-vulnerabilities`, so it physically cannot fetch its own copy. Trivy
ships its own OCI-distributed database and cannot be pointed at that snapshot, so
each Trivy job writes back the database revision it actually used and the
evaluator holds it to the same 24-hour window.

Trivy's freshness is measured from `UpdatedAt` — when upstream *built* the
database — not from when we downloaded it. Re-downloading a stale database does
not make it fresh.

> **Retrieval freshness is not publication completeness.**
> A fresh download proves the data we reasoned from was current. It cannot prove
> that every vulnerability disclosed in that window has been published upstream,
> ingested by OSV, or matched to our inventory. That gap is real and unclosable
> from inside CI. It is why the daily scan exists.

## 5. Reproducing a failure locally

Install the same pinned versions CI uses (`brew install trivy osv-scanner
gitleaks`, or see `.github/security/install-scanner.sh` for the pinned,
checksum-verified download CI performs).

```bash
# Refresh intelligence exactly as CI does, into ./intel
python3 .github/security/refresh-intelligence.py \
  --out intel --ecosystems npm \
  --probe-file package-lock.json \
  --repository Manara-Education/frontend-foundation

# Dependencies (exit 1 here means FINDINGS, not a tool error)
OSV_SCANNER_LOCAL_DB_CACHE_DIRECTORY=intel/osv-db \
  osv-scanner scan source --lockfile=package-lock.json \
  --offline-vulnerabilities --format=json

trivy fs . --scanners vuln --format json

# Configuration and image
trivy config .
docker build -t frontend-foundation:local --build-arg NODE_VERSION="$(cat .nvmrc)" .
trivy image frontend-foundation:local

# Secrets — `git`, NOT `dir`
gitleaks git . --redact
```

**Use `gitleaks git`, never `gitleaks dir`.** `dir` walks the working tree and
reads gitignored files, including `.env`, and reports them as leaks. `git` reads
commits, so it sees exactly what was actually committed.

To run the full gate decision locally, collect reports into `reports/` using the
naming `reports/<id>.<format>.json` plus `reports/status/<id>.status`, then:

```bash
python3 .github/security/evaluate.py \
  --reports-dir reports --manifest intel/intelligence-manifest.json \
  --event push --ref develop --revision "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --repository Manara-Education/frontend-foundation \
  --workspace "$PWD"
```

### Proving the gate itself still works

`.github/security/verify-gate.sh` runs 23 fixture cases against the evaluator —
clean pass, real blocking finding, scanner failure, cancellation, unexpected
skip, missing/empty/unparseable report, stale and unavailable intelligence, stale
scanner database, secrets, KEV escalation, expired/invalid/narrow exceptions,
event applicability, and per-branch resolution. Run it after any change to the
policy or the evaluator.

## 6. Findings, remediation and exceptions

Findings persist in `.github/security/findings.json`. Each carries a stable id
and its aliases (CVE / GHSA / OSV / vendor, deduplicated), severity and how it
was derived, component and version, the fix version actually reachable from the
installed version, detection method, first-seen and last-assessed timestamps, and
**which branches it is present on**.

A finding is cleared **per branch**, and only because the assessed revision no
longer contains it. Fixing something on `develop` does **not** clear it for
`main` or for a deployed image. A PR being opened or merged proves nothing on its
own — only an assessed revision does.

### Exceptions

An exception is narrow, owned, approved and time-boxed. Add it to
`.github/security/exceptions.yml` with `id`, `scope` (a specific advisory, plus
component/version/path/branch as applicable), `reason` written as evidence, a
real `owner`, an `approval` link, and an `expires` date at most 90 days out. A
missing field, an unparseable date, or a past expiry **fails the gate** — an
expired exception stops suppressing automatically.

There is currently **no** active exception in this repository.

## 7. Deployment enforcement

`deploy-production.yml` will not deploy a revision that has not passed.

It resolves the release tag to its exact commit, then **polls** for a
`Security Gate` check run on that commit — polling rather than sampling, because
the release chain and the branch scan run concurrently and the gate may still be
in flight. A failure stops the deployment immediately; a missing verdict is
treated as a failure, never a pass. If the passing verdict is older than the
policy's freshness window, a fresh scan is dispatched and its result required
instead of the stale one.

The image is then scanned **by immutable digest**, so what was scanned is
provably what is released — not merely a tag that pointed at it at the time.

## 8. Dependabot

Dependabot PRs run the same gate as human PRs; there is no exemption. The
auto-merge workflow additionally requires a check run named exactly
`Security Gate` to exist and to have concluded `success` on the head commit
before enabling auto-merge. Previously it accepted `skipped` and `neutral` as
passing and could sample the check list before the gate's check run existed —
either would have let an unscanned update merge itself.

Dependabot runs receive *Dependabot* secrets rather than Actions secrets. Nothing
in `security.yml` depends on a secret, so scans work unchanged on Dependabot and
fork PRs. No deployment credential is reachable from PR execution.

## 9. Coverage limitations — read this before trusting a green check

A passing gate means: the required assessments completed, against intelligence
inside the freshness window, and nothing matched what the policy blocks on. It
does **not** mean the revision is free of vulnerabilities.

1. **Coverage is bounded by the registered sources.** Something no source has
   published is invisible here.
2. **No private, embargoed or unpublished disclosures.** There is no live
   bug-bounty feed. Public bug-bounty reports are covered only once the vendor
   has acknowledged them *and* they have become an advisory reaching OSV or Trivy.
3. **OWASP is guidance, not a feed.** The Top 10 and ASVS say what to verify;
   they publish no per-package advisories.
4. **No maximum check age at merge time.** GitHub treats a passed required check
   as passing regardless of age. `security-revalidate.yml` re-runs assessments on
   open PRs daily and on demand, narrowing that window to about a day — it does
   not close it. There is no atomic protection against an advisory published
   between the last scan and the merge button.
5. **PRs assess the head commit, not the merge result.** A vulnerability
   introduced by the base branch after the PR forked is caught by the `develop`
   push scan and the daily scan, not by the PR's own check.
6. **This is a browser application, and the gate cannot prove authorization.**
   Every access-control decision that matters is enforced by the backend. A
   frontend check can show that a control is *called*; it cannot show the server
   enforces it. Student / instructor / admin separation, object ownership and
   paid-content access are verified in `backend-foundation`, not here.
7. **SAST finds what its rules describe.** CodeQL has no rule for most business
   logic flaws. An absent rule is not evidence of safety.
8. **Admin bypass has been removed** from the `develop` and `main` rulesets, but
   a repository admin can still edit a ruleset. Enforcement is a control, not a
   guarantee, against someone with admin rights.

## 10. OWASP coverage map

Verified current editions: **OWASP Top 10:2025**, **API Security Top 10:2023**,
**ASVS 5.0**.

| Category | Automated coverage here | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| A01 Broken Access Control / API1 BOLA, API5 BFLA | Route-guard and role-rendering tests | **Enforced server-side.** A frontend guard is a usability affordance, not a security control. |
| A02 Security Misconfiguration / API8 | `trivy config` over the Dockerfile and workflows; the Caddy security headers and the report-only CSP in `Caddyfile` | Production TLS and ingress live in `manara-infrastructure`. |
| A03 Software Supply Chain Failures | osv-scanner + Trivy + dependency-review over the full lockfile; **image scanning of the Caddy base**; pinned action SHAs; pinned, checksum-verified scanner binaries | A compromised upstream npm publish that no advisory has caught is not detected. |
| A04 Cryptographic Failures | Dependency advisories for TLS libraries in the image | Nothing cryptographic is implemented in this application. |
| A05 Injection — **stored XSS is the live risk here** | CodeQL XSS/DOM rules; the rich-content sanitizer's own tests; the report-only CSP records what a violation *would* have been | Lesson content is authored as rich text and rendered as HTML. Sanitizer correctness is the control; CSP is not yet enforcing. |
| A06 Insecure Design | — | Not automatable. Design review. |
| A07 Authentication Failures / API2 | Session and CSRF handling in `src/shared/api/`, covered by its tests | Session lifetime, OTP abuse and reset-token handling are backend concerns. |
| A08 Software or Data Integrity Failures | Immutable-digest image scanning; the deployment gate; secret scanning | — |
| A09 Logging and Alerting Failures | — | Browser-side logging is not a security control. |
| A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions | CodeQL error-handling rules; error-boundary tests | Partial. |
| API7 SSRF | — | No server-side fetching happens in this application. Remote URL handling is a backend concern. |

Gaps are listed because they are real. A category with no automated check is
tracked for manual verification, not quietly counted as covered.

## 11. Troubleshooting

**"the scanner job ended 'failure'"** — the scanner itself broke. Open that job's
log. The gate deliberately does not let a broken scanner look like a clean one.

**osv-scanner exited 1** — that means it *found* something, and is not an error.
The workflow distinguishes exit 1 from a genuine crash.

**"no database revision was recorded for this scanner job"** — a Trivy job did
not write its `reports/intel/<id>.trivydb.json` fragment, so the data it used
cannot be shown to be fresh. Usually the step was edited or reordered.

**`image-trivy` is failing on packages I do not recognise** — they come from the
base image, not from `package.json`. Check the base image tag's rebuild date
before assuming a bump will help; an upstream that has not rebuilt cannot be
fixed by re-pulling the same tag.

**"Source 'x' is N hours old"** — intelligence went stale, normally an upstream
outage. Re-run; if it persists the upstream feed is down and the gate is
correctly refusing to certify anything.

**A finding you believe is wrong** — do not lower the threshold and do not add a
blanket suppression. Either fix it, or open a narrow exception with evidence and
an approval.

**The check is not appearing on a PR** — the PR branch must contain
`security.yml`. A branch that forked before the gate landed needs a rebase.
