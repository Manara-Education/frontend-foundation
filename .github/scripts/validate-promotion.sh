#
# Decides whether a release tag may be promoted — built into an image, or
# deployed to production.
#
# The promotion workflows used to answer that question in three different places
# and to varying depths, and a manual run skipped it altogether: publish.yml and
# deploy-production.yml both began with
#
#     if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || <the real check>
#
# so anyone able to dispatch a workflow could name any semver tag, wherever it
# pointed, and have it built and shipped. Tag syntax was validated; nothing else
# was. This script is the one place that answers instead, and both entry points
# — automatic and manual — go through it.
#
# What it establishes, in order, failing closed at the first thing it cannot
# prove:
#
#   1. The tag is exactly vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
#   2. The tag exists as a TAG, and resolves to a commit. Looked up under
#      refs/tags/ specifically, and dereferenced if it is an annotated tag
#      object. `git rev-parse "$TAG"` would also happily resolve a *branch* of
#      the same name, and would hand back the tag object's own SHA rather than
#      the commit it points at.
#   3. That commit is an ancestor of origin/main. Releases come from main.
#   4. Optionally: a published, non-draft GitHub Release exists for the tag, and
#      still points at the same commit. A tag that has been moved since the
#      release was cut fails here.
#   5. Optionally: every named check has actually succeeded on that exact
#      commit, produced by GitHub Actions itself. Missing, queued, cancelled,
#      skipped, neutral and failed are all refusals — only `success` passes.
#
# Usage:
#   validate-promotion.sh --tag v1.4.0 [--require-release] [--require-checks]
#                         [--check "Build and test"] [--check "Build the image"]
#                         [--timeout-seconds 900]
#
# --check is repeated once per required check rather than taking one delimited
# list. A check run's name is free text chosen by whoever wrote the workflow, and
# this repository's own CI job is called "Install, type-check and build" — a
# comma-separated list would have split that in half and then refused every
# release for want of a check named "Install".
#
# Writes `sha=<commit>` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when it passes.
